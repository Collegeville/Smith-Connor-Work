Sparse Matrix: Matrix in which few values are nonzero
	-Special techniques used to take advantage of this property
	-Two types: structured and unstructured
		-Difference between two types makes large difference for iterative solution methods
		-Structured: Nonzero entries form regular pattern (often diagonally)

Square Matrix: Matrix in which all dimensions are equal

Singular Matrix: Matrix in which determinant is 0 (usually only one value)

Gaussian Elimination: Method to eliminate coefficients in linear systems using matrices in order to solve
the linear systems

Basic Iterative Methods: Beginning with given approximate solution, methods modify components of the 
approximation, one or few at a time and in certain order, until convergence is reached
	-Each modification called relaxation step, aims to remove one or more component of residual vector

Jacobi Method: Iterative method to solve linear equations
	-Begin with initial values for the unknowns
	-Each relaxation step results in the unknowns moving closer to convergence value

Gauss-Seidel Method: Quicker version of Jacobi method
	-As unknowns move closer to convergence, they are plugged into equation for next unknown,
	resulting in quicker convergence across the system

IMPORTANT: The better the initial guess for the iterative methods, the faster the convergence

Preconditioning: p.110
