Inputs:
	-Matrix values w/ coordinates
	-***Include 0s?
		-Save a lot of space
	-***.csv?
	-Look into other methods of reading data (lower level to allow multiple input sizes)
	-Preprocess with sklearn
	-Pickle, pandas DataFrame

Outputs:
	-One per network
		-Symm
		-Pos/Def
		-***Ask Dr. Heroux which properties would be useful

Structure:
	-Number of inputs will vary based on size of matrix
		-Start with small matrices
	-RNN
		-LSTM
		-***Ask Adam about RNNs in Keras
TO DO:
	-Step 1: Learn to read pickle data into tensor flow
	-Step 2: See if NN can deduce size of matrices
