TensorFlow Core: lowest level API, better for fine control 

High-level TensorFlow: many contain 'contrib', these are still in development

Tensor: Central unit of data in TensorFlow
	-Consists of primitive values in an array of any dimension
	-Rank: number of dimensions

Computational graph: series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes

Session: C++ backend that is used to do all computations
	-e.g. adding two nodes into a third node; using session to computate result

TensorBoard: utility that can display picture of computational graph

Placeholder: 'promise' to provide value later
	-e.g. a = tf.placeholder(..) b = tf.placeholder(..) adder_node = a + b (shortcut for tf.add(a,b))
	-Use to imput values for network

global_variables_initializer: initialize all variables in a TensorFlow program

assign: changes values of assigned variables

Optimizers: functions that slowly change variables to minimize loss function (i.e. gradient descent)

contrib.learn: high-level TensorFlow library that simplifies mechanics of machine learning

one-hot vectors: vector with 0 in most dimensions, 1 in a single dimension
