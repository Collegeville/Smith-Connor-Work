General:
-Must be square to use any iterative solver
-If symmetrical, can use ichol or ilu
-If not symmetrical, very difficult (impossible?) to converge
-Important observation: When ichol is possible, convergence MUCH faster (importance of preconditioners)
-If ichol doesn't work initially, try diagcomp
-chol with 'lower' specification works best when possible
