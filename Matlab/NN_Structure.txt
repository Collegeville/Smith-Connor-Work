Preconditioners: Matrix must be Positive Definite

KEY: Not going to have to actually solve problems, only generate Preconditioners 
	-NO MATTER WHAT, TRAINING WILL TAKE A VERY LONG TIME

First make network for Pos.Def. matrices, then add all
	***-Question to ask: is it worth preconditioning non-definite matrices??
	-Possible to slightly adjust matrices to create more data?

Initial Issue: How to export data from Matlab 
	***-One massive .csv, or one for each matrix??
	-Use another method to read data into TensorFlow
		-***Problem: Preconditioners are generally larger than original nonzero matrices


***GO OVER BOTH PLANS WITH DR.HEROUX:
	-Also ask for permission to install TensorFlow in Horizon
	-Initially only computing Positive Definite matrices
	-Is 'lower' cholesky factorization a good preconditioner for small enough matrices?

GENERATING DATA PLAN:
	-Download all Positive Definite matrices to folder
	-Create loop that runs through all matrices in folder
	-For each matrix, try all three different types of precondtioners 
		-If over certain size, don't even try option#1 (>50000?)
		-Use try/catch blocks to attempt all three preconditioners
		-Method to check if one matrix is taking too long to generate Preconditioner??
		-If third preconditioner doesn't work, increment alpha value
	-Let loop run overnight


EXPORT PLAN:
	-Create one file for each input matrix
		-Generate name for each file: i = id, ("matrix%d" % i)
	-Create a corresponding file for each preconditioner
		-Generate name for each file: i = id, ("preconditioner%d" % i)
	-Stuff data into Example protocol buffer, write to TFRecords file using TFRecordWriter
	-Use TFRecordReader with decoder to read file into NN	


Training/Testing Data:
-236 Positive Definite Matrices (190 training, 46 testing)
-Input: All values of matrices
-Output: Pre-calculated preconditioners
