Preconditioners: Matrix must be Positive Definite

KEY: Not going to have to actually solve problems, only generate Preconditioners 

Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG): 
-Only for symmetric, positive definite matrices
-Parameters: tolerance, max_iterations, preconditioners
-Calculate preconditioners with Neural Network?
	-No set number of inputs/outputs; changes based on size of Matrix
	-Could be potentially more efficient than standard Cholesky factorization
	-Training/Testing data: Generate ideal preconditioners (some already generated??)

Minimum Residual Method (minres):
-Must be symmetrical, not positive definite

Generalized Minimum Residual Method (gmres):
-Must be square

Biconjugate Gradients Stabalized (bicgstab):
-Must be square

Training/Testing Data:
-236 Positive Definite Matrices (190 training, 46 testing)
-Input: All values of matrices
-Output: Pre-calculated preconditioners
