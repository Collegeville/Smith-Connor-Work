Preconditioners: Matrix must be Positive Definite
Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG): 
-Only for symmetric, positive definite matrices
-Parameters: tolerance, max_iterations, preconditioners
-Calculate preconditioners with Neural Network?
	-No set number of inputs/outputs; changes based on size of Matrix
	-Could be potentially more efficient than standard Cholesky factorization
	-Training/Testing data: Generate ideal preconditioners (some already generated??)

Minimum Residual Method (minres):
-Must be symmetrical, not positive definite

Generalized Minimum Residual Method (gmres):
-Must be square

Biconjugate Gradients Stabalized (bicgstab):
-Must be square

LSQR:
-No requirements, may take preconditioner
