CENTRAL IDEA: Neural Network helps find initial parameter estimations, making complex equations
more efficient
	-Usually much faster than traditional parameter estimation

Parameter Estimation for Process Control (1991): A+
	-Many important parameters that effect output of Process Control Algorithms
	-Training examples
		-Input: sampled process input and output vectors
		-Output: estimated associated process parameters
	-Network implements function for estimating parameters from input/output
	-IMPORTANT: paper is from 1991, several techniques have been outdated
	-LOOK INTO: dynamic generation of training examples (during training?)
	-Trained on 6 million examples
	-When trained with 50% noise, test results significantly better (regularization)
	-Trained for one particular parameter at a time

Fast cosmological parameter estimation (2008): B-
	-Power spectra parameter computationally difficult to calculate
	-Around 10000 data points used to train
	-PICO machine learning technique (outdated)
		-Calculate required spectra and corresponding likelihoods for experiments of interest
		-Points chosen within specified parameter space 
		-Training set used to divide parameter space into ~100 smaller regions using k-means 
	-One network used for each power spectra (4)

Artificial Neural Network Approx... Parameter Estimation: A-
	-Parameter estimation key step in development of high-fidelity 
	-Parameter estimation decomposed into two subproblems
		1. Approximate NN model from given data
		2. Use derived NN model to solve simplified optimization problem to obtain parameter estimates

Hurst Parameter Estimation: B
	-Neural Network estimation method at least ten times faster than traditional methods
	-Powers of each series are inputs to NN, Hurst parameter estimate is NN output
