Parameter Estimation for Process Control (1991): A+
	-Many important parameters that effect output of Process Control Algorithms
	-Training examples
		-Input: sampled process input and output vectors
		-Output: estimated associated process parameters
	-Network implements function for estimating parameters from input/output
	-IMPORTANT: paper is from 1991, several techniques have been outdated
	-LOOK INTO: dynamic generation of training examples (during training?)
	-Trained on 6 million examples
	-When trained with 50% noise, test results significantly better (regularization)
	-Trained for one particular parameter at a time

Fast cosmological parameter estimation (2008):
	-Power spectra parameter computationally difficult to calculate
	-Around 10000 data points used to train
	-Training examples
		-Calculate required spectra and corresponding likelihoods for experiments of interest
		-Points chosen within specified parameter space
